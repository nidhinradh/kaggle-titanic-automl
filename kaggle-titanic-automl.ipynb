    "Hooray! We have covered almost all the portions that you need to know for getting started with AutoML. AutoML is the process of automating the time consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers of any experience level to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality.\n",
    "We have started with the installation of H2O, then we loaded the data to H20, checked missing data, updated those missing values and created new features. Then we trained the dataset using H2O AutoML with 15 different models and found out that GBM is a good candidate for handling this specific dataset. We also learned how to save this model and to use it for making predictions later.\n",
    "There are many things you can still do to improve this piece of code. You can do more feature engineering, standardize the numerical values, find the correlation between the dependant and independent variables, etc."
